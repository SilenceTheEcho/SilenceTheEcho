      <h1>Silence the Echo's Privacy and Security Standards</h1> 
        <p>Our site requires that the user authorize the use of the data associated with their social media
        account (Facebook/Twitter). With this authorization there is an implicit trust on the part of the user
        that their personal info will be secure. Here are some of the steps we've taken to ensure that security.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our site uses OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework that gives us limited access to your social media
          accounts. You, the user, will be able to specify whether you wish to give us read access, write access, or
          both.
          <br><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">More information about
          OAuth 2.0</a>
          <li>We do not store any of your social media account info. All data about your social media contacts is
          received through OAuth 2.0 and is never stored to be used for easier access in the future. While some of our
          services such as the "Map of Influence" could be executed more efficiently by storing user account info, we
          realize that the security of our users' personal information is a higher priority.
          <li>All items created from your social media account information such as the "Map of Influence" or media
          recommendations based on your current media influences are deleted from our servers with 24 hours of their
          creation.
          <li>All passwords for user accounts are stored in an AES 256 encrypted database.
        </ul>
