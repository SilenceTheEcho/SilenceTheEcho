# Silence the Echo
    
Welcome to **Silence The Echo**, the place where broad-minded people come to improve their minds and test their convictions.
    
We all know how good it feels to find someone who sees eye-to-eye with us on the things that matter most.
    
The goal of this site is to provide more accurate and
balanced content to social media users.

How It Works:
In order to provide users with a more balanced
social media experience, Silence The Echo will first need permission to access your social media 
news feed.  Once permission is granted, Silence The Echo will review the Media Outlet content
providers in your feed and will generate a Map of Influence regarding the political bias 
and information accuracy ratings within 24 hours.
Once your request has been completed,
you will be notified either by email or SMS text with a link to access your individual 
Map of Influence.  You will then be able to request recommendations from more balanced or 
more accurrate content providers from your Map of Influence page.
